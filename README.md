# Latitude and Weather Dashboard

https://jazminhicks.github.io/latitude_weather/

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this we pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API and created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world.

After organizing the data we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude in each city. In comparison to latitude, we looked at the following factors:

Temperature | Humidity | Cloudiness | Wind Speed

This site provides the source data and visulizations that were created during this analysis as well as explanation of trends and observations witnessed.
